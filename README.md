# devops-assignment1

About this assignment
-----------------------
This is my devops assignment 1 related to git and I really would like to know more about DevOps Culture since git is 
one of the essential tools I need to know.


Purpose
----------------
Main purpose is to get in touch with Git, know more about its nature of branches, commands, collaboration, pull requests and version control.


Collaboration procedure
-------------------------
My collaborator is Hay Mar Khaing and she created a new branch "feature by HMK/new-feature" , added some files in there and made a pull request to me.

I checked and reviewed that pull request and merged into main branch.
